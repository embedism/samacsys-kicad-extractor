[![licensebuttons by-sa](https://licensebuttons.net/l/by-nc/4.0//88x31.png)](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/)

A simple batch script that takes a .zip file from SamacSys (componentsearchengine.com) and rearranges it for easy import into KiCad Schematic and Footprint Libraries.

### Requirements ###

* You need 7-zip installed, drop 7za.exe in the same folder as the batch script (it's only 574kb)

### Usage ###

* Put the .bat script in the same place you put all of your downloaded KiCad libraries
* Drop a .zip file from SamacSys (we use rs.componentsearchengine.com) onto the .bat script
* Marvel as the folder you need is extracted and the 3D file is put inside it too
